Eye Movement for Github Portfolio Project.

**Project Title:** Eye Movement Exercise

**Project Description:** Interactive Eye Movement exercise. Move your mouse around to make the eye follow your cursor around the screen. This is an interactive experience. 

**How To Run:** To run the Eye Movement Exercise. Simply Move your cursos around the screen and look at how the eye won’t stop following you to see what you do.

**RoadMap To Future Improvements:**  In the future I would like  make the eye prettier, by adding some eyelashes and maybe a smily face. Also I would like to add a blinking movement every couple seconds to make it more realistic and fun.
